Conception-go
=============

This is a work in progress Go implementation of [Conception](https://github.com/shurcooL/Conception#demonstration).

Conception is an experimental project. It's a platform for researching software development tools and techniques. It is driven by a set of guiding principles. Conception-go targets Go development.

My "short term" goal is to implement some of the ideas shown off in Bret Victor's [Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) article. Another goal is to try to beat my current Sublime Text + GoSublime development environment setup (which sets a really high bar).

Watch this repo to follow the project's development.
